## Git tips
<a name="tips" />

* You never need to use the command line!
    + Lots of IDE's exist (gitkraken is James' fav), and turn using git into a simple point and click exercise. See **clients** for more.
* Even merge conflicts can be handled by IDE's.
    + There are lots of options for working with conflicts, but gitkraken for one allows you to point and click line by line which code to keep in a merge conflict.
* `git bisect` is useful code for finding where bugs entered the code
    + While the use is a little complicated, basically you tell git the commit where it last worked, and where it's now broken, and it can step through all the code changes letting you rerun the broken code to see exactly the change that broke the code. [Check out this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git) for more info.
