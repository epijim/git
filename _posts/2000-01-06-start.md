# Getting started at Roche

Teradata VDM has the releases stacked - make sure to use the `VALID_START` and `VALID_END` dates as each batch contains previous
  batches back to Q1 2010, and previous batches (particularly the projection factors) can be revised.

At Roche, we only ask for the raw questions, and projection factors. IPSOS though creates 100's of derived variables. As an example, there are lots of variables for line - but we only get the physicians percieved line.
