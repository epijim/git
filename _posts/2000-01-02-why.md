## Why git?
<a name="why" />

Git has two major benefits:

1. **Version control** - You can take any folder you want and say, from now on, I want to not just track changes, but also track the reasons changes were made.
2. **Collaboration** - If I'm working on a project with a colleague, we can both work on the code at the same time, and git will help us avoid any conflicts.


It's important to distinguish git from github. You can initiate a git repository on any folder, and from then on there will be a `.git` hidden folder that stores the tracked changes. This file physically lives there - so delete the `.git` folder in your git repo, and it's now just a normal folder.

*Github* is a piece of software that creates a place for git repos to live in the cloud. A git repo can live solely on github (although that would be rare), or solely in the folder on your computer (much more common), or it can live locally and on github. The really cool thing is that lots of copies can exist, i.e. one on github, one on your laptop, and one on your colleagues - and git is designed from the ground up to help keep all these copies linked. As a general rule in the open source world - the 'source of truth' or 'origin' repo
is always in the cloud (github), and never a local repo.

While it would be good practice to initiate a git repo on any folder with code, pushing that repo to Github is an optional extra step if
 you'd like to make sharing your code easier.

| Init       | `git init`                                           | This will add a folder called `.git` to the current directory, making that directory a git repo. If you make a repo using github/gitlab, by clicking `new project` you will be running a command closer to `git init --bare`, which is a special type of repo that has no **working directory**. This means that all it does is track code changes. To be confusing, gitlab/github will still let you make commits by directly editing the files via your web browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Add        | `git add <filename>`                                 | This says to git, *'Hey, there is a file I want to start tracking or I made changes in'*. In git lingo, you've **staged** a file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Commit     | `git commit <'message'>`                             | This command sets your changes in stone in the history of the repo, alongside your added message on why those changes were made. That commit is now unique - and at any point in the future you can come back and look at the code in this state (and even roll back to here if you want to throw out future changes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Push       | `git push <remote/gitlab/github> <branch of remote>` | You can work with git locally, never pulling or pushing. But - if you want a copy in the cloud to make it easy for others to see - you can now push your changes back up to the version on github/gitlab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Pull       | `git pull`                                           | This command is often confusing, as really it's just a shortcut to say **fetch** the latest code from somewhere else (usually gitlab/github), then **merge** that code into the code on my **local** repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Branch     | `git branch <name of branch>`                        | Usually you make a branch when you want to update the code, i.e. add a new feature. People use branches in many different ways, but the general idea is you leave one branch (usually the **master**, but sometimes the **production** or any othername...) as a *'central branch with the production ready code'*. And all the branches that come off this code are working on new features, that may or may not be merged back in once they are working perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Clone      | `git clone <name of repo>`                           | This is like photocopying the repo to a new location. A common example for us is that we might **init** a new repo using gitlab/github in the browser, then **clone** that repo to the GLIDE share drive. Git will automatically add the original repo as a **remote**, so later on it's easy to push new code back to github/gitlab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Checkout   | `git checkout <branch name>`                         | Usually a project will have multiple branches, and this command allows you to switch the code you are looking at to the code from a particular branch. Note that if you use this command locally (from the GLIDE drive), your **working directory** code will switch to the code in this branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Local repo | *NA*                                                 | Local usually means the working copy - where you are writing and editing code. Often for us this is actually the share drive, so the repo and all the historical information isn't really 'local', it's on the network, and our git client is logging in to the file remotely. This will make more sense to those using the command line for git, as they will have to `cd` to the share drive, while the git clients hide these steps from you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Fork       | *NA*                                                 | This is a concept unique to gitlab/github, and not part of normal **git**. Importantly, if the project is public, anyone can fork it. Essentially, when you click **fork** in github or gitlab you are saying I want to make a copy of your project, but my 1st intention isn't to expand your original code, instead I *might* head in a new direction.The might is important, as you can still merge back changes in the **fork**, but rather than being able to merge directly like you would with a **branch**, you instead have to make a **pull request** for the original repo owner to pull back your code. **Forks** may not make much sense for how we are likely to work here at Roche, compared to the thousands of people who may be interested in big open source projects. As (an example) the bootstrap HTML template has more than 39,000 **forks**, many by random members of the public, but there are only 17 development **branches** maintained by the bootstrap *'contributors'* (people with access to edit the original repo). |
