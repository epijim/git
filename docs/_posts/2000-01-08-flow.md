## Git flow
<a name="flow" />

**Git flow** is just a catchy way of saying the sequence of steps you like to take, our your team decided to take, when working with code. There are many competing **git flows** (with the github and gitlab recomendations being very popular). This is really important, git is a super flexible piece of software, and so git flows are a method to come up with standard ways of using git that make colloboration better.

The following flow is how I (James) like to work, and is just a discussion starter till RWDS has a plan. I am ignoring the fact that having a GLIDE share drive is exactly what git was designed to avoid needing.

1. Initiate the repo on the GLIDE drive and start making local commits.
    + If the project is small and quick, this is as far as I go in git (so this repo never touches  :octocat:). All the information about the repo is still in my folder in the GLIDE drive, hiding in a sub folder called `.git`. So if another analyst wanted, they could still go to the GLIDE folder and look through all my previous versions.
    + Only if the project is important, I know there'll be lots of iterations, or want to share the code, I move on to the next steps.
2. Add github as a remote and push a copy to the RWDS group.
3. Outputs start being shared before the project is closed, so I move from using just one branch, to a *master*/*development* branched repo
    + If I have something like an early set of results, or it's something that will be continously iterated like a shiny app, I need a clearer way to seperate when things are sharable, and when I'm still working.
    + I will create a branch called *development*, and locally (on the GLIDE drive), I will `checkout` the *development* branch, so now any changes I do will not effect the master.
4. After making some edits, I'm ready to update the app/output and reshare. So I'll `merge` my *development* branch back into the *master* branch.
    + This workflow means, when looking at my branches, if I scan through the *master* branch, I can easily see each production ready iteration. I.e. the commits here are all merges, and in each merge I've left a message saying something like, 'pushing first draft to share server to share with scientist', then the next step in the *master* branch might be, 'showing tool to GPET for comments',  and so on. While if I look at the *development* branch, I can see all the little steps it took to move from the first draft to the GPET ready draft.

This workflow is just an example, but the use of branches becomes incredibly powerful in large projects. For example, the first cut macro is a key piece of shared code, and in the first cut macro there are branches set like this:

* **master** This is the main branch, and the one people should source.
* **development** This version has working code, but hasn't been tested and deemed 'safe' to roll out. If a quick fix is needed, we can edit it on this branch, then when the fix is working, `merge` this branch back over to the **master**
* **features** These are branches (which will have a variety of names) where someone has branched the **development** branch in order to build a big new feature, like a new set of options that let you run the code on Optum. Once the feature is finished they would ``merge`` this back into the **development**, test it, then `merge` it across to the **master**.
*  **fork** which is actually not a branch - but if someone wanted the hypothetical Optum option I mentioned above to be a different macro, rather then selected via adding options to the original, they could **fork** the repo, which will make a new copy of the code but it won't automatically add in the original repo as a `remote`.

## Example flow

Shown below is an actual *github-style* git flow, James has used. The `master` branch represents significant versions, and a tag has been used to note when the `master` was first shared with a stakeholder. The `develop` branch represents more granular changes. Coming off `devlop` are short lived branches, which represent the steps needed to complete a single distinct change. I call these smallest branches 'feature' branches. I.e. `feature/cericomment` represents small changes that were made after talking with a colleague.
